# ai-models

A block of artificial intelligence models self implemented with Pytorch.

1 - Simple Linear Regression, (y = x * w + b) <br>
2 - Logistic Regression, (y = x * w + b) + sigmoid layer <br>
3 - Feedforward Neural Networks, (y = x * w + b) * multiple layers + activation layer (hidden features) <br>
4 - Convulsion Neural Networks, (channels, kernel, padding & strid) + filter per area <br>
5 - Recurrent Neural Networks, (time series ou sentences predictions) <br>
6 - Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Networks, multiple gate, but with update and reset gate existing in the same cell simultaneous<br>
7 - Linear Regression with Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm<br>
